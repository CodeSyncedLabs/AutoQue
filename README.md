# What is AutoQue?
  AutoQue is an idea that SuperScary has while he was working as the Sound Operator for a local ballet show. At that show he used QLab, an inovative way to queue music and other medias for live show purposes. Unfortuanately, QLab is only available for Mac OS. AutoQue wants to combat this by allowing any system to run it as long as the system has Java 8 or higher installed.
