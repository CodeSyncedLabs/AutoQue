# AutoQue
  err... Huston, we have a problem!
  
# What is AutoQue?
  AutoQue is an idea that SuperScary has while he was working as the Sound Operator for a local ballet show. At that show he used QLab, an inovative way to queue music and other medias for live show purposes. Unfortuanately, QLab is only available for Mac OS. AutoQue wants to combat this by allowing any system to run it as long as the system has Java 8 or higher installed.
  
  AutoQue is open source, meaning you are free to go through the source code. While it (most likely) will be free, we need to eat too. Donations are greatfully accepted, although not required. If you enjoy what is being done here, please consider donating! Here is the donation link: https://www.paypal.me/WylanShoemaker

# What does it do?
  Right now (September 19, 2016), not much. The project is still in its infancy. Do not fret however! Loads, and we mean LOADS, of features are going to come to the project. This project is supposed to be an autonomous sound queue system, meaning it will have to do lots of things for it to be considered useful in actual productions!

# What features will this include?
  While not completed, we do have an idea for what it should be able to do. Please note that any listed feature is subject to change.
  Other than basic functions, such as media playback and of course, auto queuing, here is a list of ideas that may possibly be in the final version.
  - Control hertz output for media
  - Change output device per media node
  - Change output device per media node track time
  - In-line editor
  - Video playback node
  - Video playback editor
  - Create queue sheets in a .xml format
  - ShowTime mode - fade/dim the screen when in show to prevent unneeded light
  - More to come :)

# Please Note:
  AutoQue is being developed in our free time. We enjoy programming as a pastime, some of us are still in school and will not always be available to help, please do not take this in the wrong way. We LOVE user feedback. Our product can only survive with the help of the users. If you find any bugs, please report it on our issue tracker along with a way to reproduce it. 

  AutoQue is being developed in Intellij IDEA and not the standard Eclipse IDE. This is so there is an ease of access as well as organization. We cannot garuntee that cloning this repository into an Eclipse project will work.
