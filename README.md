# AutoQue

  err... Huston, we have a problem!
  
# What is AutoQue?
  AutoQue is an idea that SuperScary has while he was working as the Sound Operator for a local ballet show. At that show he used QLab, an inovative way to queue music and other medias for live show purposes. Unfortuanately, QLab is only available for Mac OS. AutoQue wants to combat this by allowing any system to run it as long as the system has Java 8 or higher installed.

# What does it do?
  Right now (September 19, 2016), not much. The project is still in its infancy. Do not fret however! Loads, and I mean LOADS, of features are going to come to the project. This project is supposed to be an autonomous sound queue system, meaning it will have to do lots of things for it to be considered useful in actual productions!
